// question one : create a varible of type string and add varible of number type to it and print it to the console.
// answer:
let string_var="hello this is question";
let number_var=1;
// console.log(string_var+' '+number_var); //run this to get the answer
// question two : find the data type of the variable 'string_var' created in question one
// answer:
console.log(typeof(string_var)); //run this to get the answer
// question three : create a const object try to change it later!
const object_var={
    name:"john",
    age:20
    
}
// object_var=17; // this will throw an error as we are trying to change the value of a const variable [TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.]
// question four : create a const array try to change it later!
// object_var.name="jane"; //this will not throw an error as we are not changing the value of the const variable but the value of the object inside the const variable
console.log(object_var);
